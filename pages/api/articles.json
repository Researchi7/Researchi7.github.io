    "abstract": "The integration of preference alignment with diffusion models (DMs) has emerged as a transformative approach to enhance image generation and editing capabilities. Although integrating diffusion models with preference alignment strategies poses significant challenges for novices at this intersection, comprehensive and systematic reviews of this subject are still notably lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper extensively surveys preference alignment with diffusion models in image generation and editing. First, we systematically review cutting-edge optimization techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), and others, highlighting their pivotal role in aligning preferences with DMs. Then, we thoroughly explore the applications of aligning preferences with DMs in autonomous driving, medical imaging, robotics, and more. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the challenges of preference alignment with DMs. To our knowledge, this is the first survey centered on preference alignment with DMs, providing insights to drive future innovation in this dynamic area.",

    "title": "Serverless LoRA Serving",
    "conference": "Martin-Space Blog",
    "cover_image": "mlsys.jpg",
    "year": "May, 2025",
    "abstract": "Recently, we explore how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning can be effectively combined with serverless inference using the ServerlessLLM framework. It addresses key challenges of deploying large language models (LLMs) in serverless environments, such as cold start latency, GPU resource demands, and the need for stateful processing. ServerlessLLM mitigates these issues through chunk-based model loading, live migration, and startup-aware scheduling. LoRA's lightweight nature makes it ideal for serverless use—enabling quick adapter loading, dynamic switching, and cost-efficient deployment. The implementation supports transformers backend, adapter hot-swapping, and efficient resource use. Future plans include supporting full fine-tuning, adapter fusion, and a dedicated backend for tuning, aiming to make LLM deployment and experimentation more accessible to resource-constrained users.",
